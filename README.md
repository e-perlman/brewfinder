# BREWFINDER

## Description

Brewfinder is a JS application that uses DOM manipulation for user interaction. This application allows the user to search for breweries by any combination of the following search parameters: state, city, keyword and brewery type. I live in Portland, OR which has been know as one of the best beer cities in the country. A great way for me to explore the city has been to visit local breweries, and this application makes it easy for everyone to do so!
